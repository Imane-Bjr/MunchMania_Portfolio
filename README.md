## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- Install **MongoDB** if you're running the database locally or ensure access to a MongoDB cloud service such as MongoDB Atlas.
- You need **npm** or **yarn** as a package manager. Use `npm` by default if unsure.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/munchmania.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd munchmania-server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the server and add the following environment variables:

     ```bash
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/your-db-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

   Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `your-db-name` with the appropriate MongoDB Atlas credentials or your local MongoDB instance.

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

5. **Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd munchmania-client
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the client:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The client will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

7. **Connect the server to the MongoDB database:**

   Ensure that MongoDB is running or you're connected to your MongoDB Atlas instance, and the backend will automatically connect and sync data.
